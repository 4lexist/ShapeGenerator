# ShapeGenerator
Quick JS assignment for hiring purpose - The goal of this task is to write a simple HTML/JavaScript program that interacts with the user and draws geometrical shapes to the screen. The program should be launched by viewing “index.html” in a modern, standards-compliant, web browser.

## Install
* `git clone https://github.com/4lexist/ShapeGenerator.git`
* `open ShapeGenerator`
* double-click on `index.html` (or open it with your prefered web browser)

## Usage
You can click anywhere on the screen, your first three clicks will create 3 red dots that will generate a parallelogram and a circle of same area and center. Once the three dots placed, you can then drag them wherever you want and watch the shapes evolve accordingly.

## Next steps
* Add browser compatibility (it currently works only on Chrome)
* Improve style
* Remove ghost image when dragging dots
